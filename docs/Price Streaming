# Price Streaming


## Overview

The price streaming feature generates tick data at random intervals defined under a set of constraints, following
random walk process or eventually a biased random walk process.

The set of constraints under which the tick price is emitted are the following:

- average frequency [ticks/second]: The average amount of ticks to emit per second, considering a normal distribution.
- frequency deviation [ticks/second]: Standard deviation for the ticks per second (given the normal distribution)
