# Syntethick Library

This is a Work In progress for a library to generate synthetic price time series.

At the core, it generates tick data, at regular intervals for now.

To generate tick data you can control the trend, the volatility and the spread range.

# TODO's

1. Improve spread calculation: Current version calculates a spread skewed to the lower limit
of the spread range.

2. Produce ticks at random intervals
